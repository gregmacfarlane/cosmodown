This package provides a template for writing theses and dissertations at the
Brigham Young University using **rmarkdown** and **bookdown**. Much of this was
inspired by the [**thesisdown**](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) package
by Chester Ismay, and this particular implementation was taken directly from [**jahawkdown**](https://github.com/wjakethompson/jayhawkdown) by Jake Thompson.

The original LaTeX template and class document were written by Greg Macfarlane, and modified for use with pandoc and R markdown.

## Installation

You can install cosmodown from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gregmacfarlane/cosmodown")
```

You also need a working LaTeX program:

* Macintosh: [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)
* Linux: [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html)
* Windows: [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html)

## Example Usage

The recommended way to use this template is with RStudio; however, it is possible to use this template with a different IDE.

### RStudio Usage

1. Open a new RStudio window.
2. Open a new R Markdown document.

    ```{r select-rmd, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("README/rmarkdown.png")
    ```

3. Select from templates, the University of Kansas Thesis template from the **jayhawkdown** package.

    ```{r select-template, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("README/select-template.png")
    ```

4. Because there are multiple files for this template, you must create a directory to house them, and choose a location for the directory. I suggest calling this directory `index` (you can change this later, but this will make your main R Markdown document be called `index.rmd`).
5. Select "OK", and the template should open automatically. Press the "Knit" button at the top of the editor to render the template, and read the document for instructions on how to edit the template for your specific paper.

    ```{r knit-tempalte, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("README/knit.png")
    ```

6. If the PDF does not open automatically, you will be able to find it in the newly created `_book/` directory.

### Other Usage

If you are not using RStudio, you can create a new R Markdown from the **jayhawkdown** template by using `rmarkdown::draft()`.

1. Open R in your preferred IDE.
2. Open the **jayhawkdown** template using `rmarkdown::draft()`. This will create a directory called `index/` (or whatever you name the R Markdown document) in your current working directory.

    ```{r draft, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    rmarkdown::draft("index.rmd", template = "kansas", package = "jayhawkdown",
      create_dir = TRUE)
    ```

3. When the template opens, you can render the document using `bookdown::render_book()`.

    ```{r render-book, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    setwd("index/")
    bookdown::render_book("index.rmd", "jayhawkdown::thesis_pdf")
    ```

4. If the PDF does not open automatically, you will be able to find it in the newly created `_book/` directory.

### Troubleshooting

If the example PDF fails to render, try these steps:

* If you are not using RStudio, attempt to render in RStudio.
* Make sure your LaTeX environment was successfully setup.
* Make sure your R packages are up to date, specifically **rmarkdown**, **bookdown**, **jayhawkdown**, and **knitr**.

If errors persist after trying all of these steps, post your process along with the resulting error to a [new issue](https://github.com/wjakethompson/jayhawkdown/issues) on Github, and I will try to help.
