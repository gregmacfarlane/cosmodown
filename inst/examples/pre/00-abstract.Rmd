The **jayhawkdown** package can be used to write theses and dissertations in R Markdown that meet the formatting requirements of the University of Kansas. By harnessing the power R Markdown, we are able to write prose in the simplified markdown language and render the output as a PDF document. Thus, we get the benefits of \LaTeX\ without having to actually write any \LaTeX\ code. R Markdown also allows analysis code to be included directly in the document. This means the results, figures, and tables can be dynamically populated directly in the paper, making everything completely reproducible. Finally, because **jayhawkdown** is built on top of the **bookdown** package, it's also possible to render your document to other output formats, such as a website.
